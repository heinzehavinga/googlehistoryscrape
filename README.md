====================

A small Pythonw scrape script for Google History
You'll need (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)[Beautiful Soup]
 and (https://github.com/jdunck/python-unicodecsv)[Unicode CSV writer].

The script checks all the html files in your directory and tries
to add it's content into a CSV file.

Just go to (https://history.google.com/history/lookup?num=1000)[Google History] and download some pages in the same directory and run the script.
