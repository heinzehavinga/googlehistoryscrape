googlehistoryscraper
====================

A small Pythonw scrape script for Google History
You'll need Beautiful Soup http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
 and the Unicode CSV writer https://github.com/jdunck/python-unicodecsv.

The script checks all the html files in your directory and tries
to add it's content into a CSV file.

Just go to https://history.google.com/history/lookup?num=1000
and download some pages in the same directory as scrape.py  and run the script.
